Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LLM Differential Privacy project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Git
- A GitHub account
- Basic understanding of differential privacy and machine learning

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLMEncrption2.git
   cd LLMEncrption2
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv dp_env
   source dp_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dp_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt[dev]  # For development tools
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings for new functions/classes
- Update type hints and comments
- Include examples in docstrings

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write your code following the style guidelines
- Add tests for your changes
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
flake8 .
black --check .
mypy .

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Test the main functionality
python LLM_Diffrential_Privacy.py --encrypt-data --records 10
python LLM_Diffrential_Privacy.py --train --records 5 --epochs 1
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes

- Detailed description of what was changed
- Why the change was made
- Any breaking changes or considerations"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.
