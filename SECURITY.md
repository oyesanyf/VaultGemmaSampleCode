## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users.

### 2. **Email us directly**
Send an email to: `security@yourdomain.com` (replace with your actual security email)

### 3. **Include the following information:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information (optional)

### 4. **Response timeline:**
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

## 🔍 What We Consider Security Issues

### High Priority
- **Privacy leaks**: Any mechanism that could leak sensitive data
- **Authentication bypass**: Ways to bypass security controls
- **Code injection**: Vulnerabilities that allow code execution
- **Data exposure**: Unintended exposure of PHI/PII data

### Medium Priority
- **Information disclosure**: Leakage of non-sensitive information
- **Denial of service**: Issues that could cause service disruption
- **Configuration issues**: Misconfigurations that reduce security

### Low Priority
- **Documentation issues**: Security-related documentation problems
- **Minor privacy concerns**: Issues with minimal impact

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **PHI/PII Handling**: All sensitive data is properly masked or perturbed
- **Differential Privacy**: Built-in privacy guarantees with VaultGemma
- **Data Isolation**: Clear separation between sensitive and protected data
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative privacy parameters by default

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP secure coding practices
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning
- **Access Controls**: Proper file permissions and access management

### Privacy Guarantees
- **Built-in DP**: VaultGemma model with ε≤2.0, δ≤1.1e-10
- **Additional DP-SGD**: Optional Opacus integration
- **Data-level DP**: Laplace mechanism for synthetic data
- **Secure RNG**: Optional cryptographic randomness

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update all packages
2. **Use secure configurations**: Follow recommended privacy parameters
3. **Protect sensitive data**: Never commit PHI/PII to version control
4. **Monitor access**: Keep track of who has access to sensitive data
5. **Regular audits**: Periodically review privacy settings

### For Developers
1. **Security reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
2. **Privacy testing**: Test privacy guarantees with each change
3. **Secure defaults**: Always use secure default configurations
4. **Input validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
5. **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Code analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Privacy testing**: Automated tests for privacy guarantees
- **Configuration validation**: Checks for secure configurations

### Manual Reviews
- **Code reviews**: All changes reviewed for security issues
- **Privacy audits**: Regular privacy impact assessments
- **Penetration testing**: Periodic security testing
- **Threat modeling**: Regular threat model updates

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are **NOT** considered security issues:
- **Performance issues**: Unless they cause DoS
- **Feature requests**: Unless they have security implications
- **Documentation errors**: Unless they lead to security misconfigurations
- **Cosmetic issues**: UI/UX problems without security impact
